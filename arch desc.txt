Architecture 1:
Uses three convolutional layers with decreasing kernel sizes.
Applies ReLU activation and batch normalization after each convolutional layer.
Includes a dense layer with 100 units and a dropout layer.

Architecture 2:
Similar to Architecture 1 but includes padding in convolutional layers.
Padding helps maintain spatial dimensions in the convolutional layers.

Architecture 3:
Similar to Architecture 2 but uses a larger number of units (500) in the dense layer.

Architecture 4:
Similar to Architecture 2 but removes one convolutional layer from the end.
Reduces the depth of the network.

Architecture 5:
Utilizes depthwise separable convolution in the first convolutional layer.
Depthwise separable convolution reduces the number of parameters and computation.

Architecture 6:
Similar to Architecture 5 but removes one convolutional layer from the end.
Also uses depthwise separable convolution.

Architecture 7:
Introduces an identity block (residual connection) after the initial convolutional layers.
Uses depthwise separable convolution.
Includes a dense layer with 500 units.
